CS 320 Software Test Automation and Quality Assurance

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

By using software testing throughout the development process, including automated testing, and following secure protocols with my code, such as using SSL and encryption, I can ensure that my code or software is functional and secure. Following preset templates for testing, and automating the tests, allows multiple proven tests to be run on the code and ensures that the code follows pre-set standards for function and security.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I would follow the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process and generate user stories for the needs, and then use the stories to determine the wants and actual needs of the user to design the functions of the program. The user stories will give me an idea of what functionality the client is needing, and then I can create the functions needed to accomplish that.

How do I approach designing software?

When I am designing software, I first set up a class diagram to make sure that all of the fuctions that are needed are included, and that they are going to interrelate with each other. I use this as a template for writing the code needed. The code should follow proper object-oriented design practices such as abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. I also need to make sure there is extensive documentation of my work, so that others can see and understand the code that I wrote.
